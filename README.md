# PaneraCheese

PaneraCheese project that I completed in my Introduction to Java II class in the spring 2021 semester. Based on the fast food resturant Panera Bread, this project helps with
understanding queues through a scenerio of customers making an order though user input, being able to see what orders are pending in the queue, seeing which orders are being
served, and cancelling an order.
